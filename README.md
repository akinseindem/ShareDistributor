===================

Automated Dividend Distribution for Tokenized Shares
----------------------------------------------------

This is a **Clarity smart contract** designed to manage tokenized shares and automate the proportional distribution of dividends to shareholders. It is built to be a robust, secure, and auditable system for managing equity and payouts on the Stacks blockchain. The contract supports multiple, distinct dividend rounds, employs a snapshot mechanism to ensure fair distribution, and prevents double-claiming of funds.

üöÄ Features
-----------

-   **Tokenized Share Management:** Functions for issuing and transferring internal, non-fungible shares (represented by a simple balance map).

-   **Proportional Dividend Distribution:** Calculates dividends based on a shareholder's stake relative to the total shares at the time the dividend round was created.

-   **Dividend Round Snapshot:** When a new dividend round is initiated, the contract takes a **snapshot** of the total shares issued (`total-shares`) to serve as the denominator for distribution calculations. This ensures fairness, as share transfers *after* the round creation do not affect the total dividend pool calculation for that round.

-   **Claim Prevention:** Utilizes the `dividend-claims` map to prevent shareholders from claiming the dividend for a specific round more than once.

-   **Dual Distribution Methods:**

    -   **`claim-dividend` (Pull):** Shareholders can call this function themselves to claim their proportional amount.

    -   **`batch-distribute-dividends` (Push):** The contract owner can distribute dividends to a list of shareholders in a single transaction, useful for proactive distribution.

-   **Owner-Controlled Functions:** Key management functions like `issue-shares` and `create-dividend-round` are restricted to the contract owner (`tx-sender`).

-   **Secure Fund Management:** The `dividend-reserve` variable tracks the total outstanding dividend pool within the contract, ensuring all calculations are based on available funds.

### Data Structures

| **Data Structure** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `share-balances` | `map<principal, uint>` | Tracks the current share balance for every address. |
| `total-shares` | `data-var<uint>` | Total number of shares ever issued. |
| `current-dividend-round` | `data-var<uint>` | The highest (latest) dividend round number created. |
| `dividend-pools` | `map<uint, uint>` | Stores the total dividend amount (e.g., in STX or other token unit) designated for a specific round number. |
| `dividend-claims` | `map<{shareholder: principal, round: uint}, bool>` | Tracks which shareholders have claimed their dividend for a given round. |
| `shares-snapshot` | `map<uint, uint>` | Stores the **total** shares issued at the moment a specific dividend round was created, ensuring the distribution base is fixed. |
| `round-active` | `map<uint, bool>` | Tracks whether a specific dividend round is open for claiming/distribution. |
| `dividend-reserve` | `data-var<uint>` | The total amount of dividends currently pooled within the contract awaiting distribution across all active rounds. |

* * * * *

üîí Private (Internal) Functions
-------------------------------

These functions are not directly callable by external users; they implement the core business logic and security checks used by the public functions.

| **Function** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `calculate-dividend` | Calculates a shareholder's proportional dividend amount using the formula: $\frac{\text{Shareholder Shares}}{\text{Total Shares Snapshot}} \times \text{Total Dividend Pool}$. It handles division by zero by returning `u0` if the snapshot is zero. |
| `has-minimum-shares` | A simple boolean check to ensure a given `shareholder` principal holds at least `u1` share. |
| `is-contract-owner` | Returns `true` if the `tx-sender` is the contract's deployer (`contract-owner`), used for access control on key management functions. |
| `update-balance` | Internal helper to safely update the `share-balances` map for a given address. |
| `process-shareholder-dividend` | A helper function used within the `batch-distribute-dividends` call. It checks if the shareholder has shares and hasn't claimed yet, and if so, sets their claim status to `true` for the current dividend round. **Note:** In a complete implementation, this would also include the logic for transferring the dividend amount. |

* * * * *

### Public Functions

| **Function** | **Access** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `issue-shares` | **Owner Only** | Mints a new number of shares to a recipient, increasing their balance and `total-shares`. |
| `transfer-shares` | Public | Allows a shareholder to transfer shares between addresses. |
| `create-dividend-round` | **Owner Only** | Initiates a new dividend round. Takes a snapshot of `total-shares` and sets the `dividend-amount` for the new round. Updates `dividend-reserve`. |
| `claim-dividend` | Public | Allows a shareholder to claim their proportional dividend for a specific, active round. Checks against the claim map and snapshot data. |
| `batch-distribute-dividends` | **Owner Only** | Owner can push dividends to a list of shareholders for a given round, marking their claims as processed. |

### Read-Only Functions

| **Function** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `get-share-balance` | Retrieves the current share balance for a given account. |
| `get-total-shares` | Retrieves the current total shares issued. |
| `has-claimed-dividend` | Checks if a shareholder has claimed their dividend for a specific round. |
| `get-current-round` | Retrieves the most recently created dividend round number. |
| `get-dividend-pool` | Retrieves the total dividend amount allocated for a specific round. |

üõ†Ô∏è Usage Example (Conceptual)
------------------------------

### 1\. **Setup and Share Issue (Owner)**

The contract owner deploys the contract and issues the initial shares.

Code snippet

```
(issue-shares 'ST000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 'u1000) ;; Owner gets 1000 shares
(issue-shares 'ST1SJ3DVKQ8YTWJ8B6XJG4MTW1JJQJT0000000000000 'u500) ;; Shareholder A gets 500 shares
;; Total shares = 1500

```

### 2\. **Create Dividend Round (Owner)**

The owner creates the first round, funding it with 15,000 units.

Code snippet

```
(create-dividend-round u15000)
;; current-dividend-round is now u1.
;; shares-snapshot for round u1 is u1500.
;; dividend-pools for round u1 is u15000.
;; dividend-reserve is u15000.

```

### 3\. **Shareholder Claims (Shareholder A)**

Shareholder A claims their dividend:

-   Shareholder A shares: 500

-   Snapshot total shares: 1500

-   Total dividend pool: 15,000

-   Calculation (via `calculate-dividend`): $\frac{500}{1500} \times 15000 = 5000$

Code snippet

```
(claim-dividend u1)
;; Returns ok u5000.
;; dividend-reserve is now u10000.
;; dividend-claims for {shareholder: 'ST1..., round: u1} is true.

```

‚ö†Ô∏è Security and Completeness Note
---------------------------------

This contract provides the **logic** for proportional dividend calculation and claim management. However, in a complete dApp:

1.  **Token Transfer:** The `claim-dividend` function should include a **real fungible token transfer** (e.g., using `stx-transfer-from?` or a call to an external token contract's `ft-transfer?`) to send the calculated `dividend-amount` to the `tx-sender`. This requires the contract to hold the dividend tokens or to be approved to spend them.

2.  **Asset Handling:** An external function (not included) would be necessary for the owner to fund the contract's reserve with the actual tokens *before* calling `create-dividend-round`, or for `create-dividend-round` to handle the token deposit as part of the transaction.

3.  **Error Handling for Batch:** The current `batch-distribute-dividends` uses a private helper `process-shareholder-dividend` that only marks the claim as true but does not perform the token transfer. A robust implementation would need to handle failed token transfers gracefully within the batch, likely by using a safe fold/map function that accumulates successful transfers and ensures atomicity where possible, or logs failures.

üìú Error Codes
--------------

| **Code** | **Constant** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `u100` | `err-owner-only` | The transaction sender is not the contract owner. |
| `u101` | `err-insufficient-balance` | Sender's share balance is too low, or the contract's dividend reserve is insufficient. |
| `u102` | `err-invalid-amount` | The amount specified is zero or invalid (e.g., dividend calculation resulted in zero). |
| `u103` | `err-already-claimed` | Dividend for this round has already been claimed by the shareholder. |
| `u104` | `err-no-dividends` | The dividend pool for the specified round is zero. |
| `u105` | `err-not-shareholder` | The caller has zero shares. |
| `u106` | `err-transfer-failed` | (Reserved for potential external token transfer failures). |
| `u107` | `err-round-not-active` | The dividend round is not active (i.e., it has been closed). |
| `u108` | `err-invalid-shares` | Total shares is zero, preventing dividend calculation. |
